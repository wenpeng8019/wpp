Why MIT License?
----------------

SQTP is designed to be a protocol and library that can be freely used in both
open-source and commercial projects:

1. **Permissive**: Allows use in proprietary software
2. **Simple**: Easy to understand and comply with
3. **Compatible**: Works with most other licenses including GPL
4. **No Attribution Required**: While appreciated, not legally required
5. **Industry Standard**: One of the most popular open-source licenses

Usage Guidelines
----------------

You are free to:
  ✅ Use SQTP in commercial projects
  ✅ Modify the protocol implementation
  ✅ Use the JavaScript libraries as-is or modified
  ✅ Redistribute the code
  ✅ Use without attribution (though appreciated)
  ✅ Combine with other licenses

The only requirement:
  📋 Include this license text if you redistribute the code

Note on the Main WPP Project
-----------------------------

While SQTP and its libraries are MIT licensed, the main WPP project that
implements the SQTP server is licensed under GPL 3.0. This means:

  * SQTP Protocol Specification: MIT (this file)
  * SQTP JavaScript Libraries: MIT (this file)
  * WPP Server Implementation: GPL 3.0 (see main LICENSE file)

This dual-licensing approach allows:
  1. Anyone to implement SQTP clients/servers under any license
  2. The reference JavaScript libraries to be used freely
  3. The WPP server implementation to remain GPL 3.0

For questions about licensing, please contact the WPP Project maintainers.
